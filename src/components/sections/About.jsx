          <p>
            I'm a strategic operator and builder who thrives at the intersection of business, technology, and organizational transformation. Over 12+ years, I've led global initiatives that blend product innovation, operational excellence, and emerging technology adoption, helping enterprises scale with confidence while staying agile in fast-changing markets.
          </p>

          <p>
            My foundation was built in the U.S. Navy, where I served as a Cryptologic Technician Interpretive with TS/SCI clearance. I graduated from one of the military's most rigorous programs, the Defense Language Institute's Chinese-Mandarin course, and worked in elite intelligence operations. That experience taught me discipline, adaptability, and how to make high-stakes decisions with incomplete information. These are skills that define how I lead today.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've steered multi-million-dollar digital programs, redefined release pipelines, and introduced AI-driven enablement strategies that reshaped how technical and business teams collaborate. Beyond delivery, I've architected processes that unlock efficiency, guided financial decisions to protect margin and value, and mentored cross-functional teams into high-performing, resilient units.
          </p>

          <p>
            My career spans diverse sectors, from AI and XR innovation to hospitality, SaaS, and enterprise web platforms. Whether partnering with executives, advising boards, or guiding teams, I translate complex goals into momentum and measurable outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond delivery, I'm deeply motivated by creating environments where people can do their best work, grow in confidence, and actually enjoy what they're doing. I love rethinking how teams operate: simplifying processes, improving communication, and removing friction so work feels purposeful rather than exhausting. I'm especially invested in advocating for positive work culture and supporting others as they grow into the best versions of themselves.
