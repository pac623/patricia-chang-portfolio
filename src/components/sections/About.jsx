            I'm a strategic operator and builder who thrives at the intersection of business, technology, and organizational transformation. Over 12+ years, I've led global initiatives that blend product innovation, operational excellence, and emerging technology adoption—helping enterprises scale with confidence while staying agile in fast-changing markets.

          <p>
            My foundation was built in the U.S. Navy, where I served as a Cryptologic Technician Interpretive with TS/SCI clearance. I graduated from one of the military's most rigorous programs—the Defense Language Institute's Chinese-Mandarin course—and worked in elite intelligence operations I still can't discuss. I earned a leadership position in Boot Camp and was promoted three ranks upon graduation. That experience taught me discipline, adaptability, and how to make high-stakes decisions with incomplete information—skills that define how I lead today.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've steered multi-million-dollar digital programs, redefined release pipelines, and introduced AI-driven enablement strategies that reshaped how technical and business teams collaborate. Beyond delivery, I've architected processes that unlock efficiency, guided financial decisions to protect margin and value, and mentored cross-functional teams into high-performing, resilient units.
          </p>

          <p>
            My career spans diverse sectors—from AI and XR innovation to hospitality, SaaS, and enterprise web platforms. I've founded initiatives, authored thought leadership, and driven growth in roles that combine product management, operations, and strategic advisory. Whether partnering with executives, advising boards, or guiding teams, I translate complex goals into momentum and measurable outcomes.
